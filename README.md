# SurveyForm-freeCodeCamp
This projected counted toward my Responsive Web Design certification through freeCodeCamp.org. 
For this project, I built a survey form to collect data from users.

  <li>If you enter an email that is not formatted correctly, you will see an HTML5 validation error</li>
  <li>Inside the form, you can enter a number in an input field that has an id of number</li>
  <li>The number input should not accept non-numbers, either by preventing you from typing them or by showing an HTML5 validation error (depending on your browser).</li>
  <li>If you enter numbers outside the range of the number input, which are defined by the min and max attributes, you will see an HTML5 validation error</li>
  <li>For the name, email, and number input fields, you can see corresponding label elements in the form, that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids: id="name-label", id="email-label", and id="number-label"</li>
  <li>For the name, email, and number input fields, you can see placeholder text that gives a description or instructions for each field</li>
